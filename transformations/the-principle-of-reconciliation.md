# The principle of reconciliation

***

## Definition

Reconciliation refers to the ability to match data from different sources and detect data representing the same entity. More specifically, it allows for the comparison of data originating from ad-centric sources with site-centric data to understand the economic impacts of advertising dissemination.

### Example

{% hint style="info" %}
Thanks to Quanti: transformation methods, it is possible, for instance, to have in the same table, the spends on Google Ads (Ad-centric) and the revenue generated from the Google / cpc source (Site-centric). Then, it automatically calculates the return on advertising spend (ROAS - Return On Ads Spend).
{% endhint %}

## The benefits of the method

### 1. Automatic collection

Thanks to our suite of [marketing connectors](../connectors/readme/) and [analytics connectors](../connectors/analytics-connectors/), data retrieval from your platforms is automatically carried out in a scheduled manner so that each morning you can benefit from your data from the previous day. At this step, you have your data, but it is isolated in dedicated datasets and still requires a transformation step to align data from various sources around common metrics.

### 2. Data aggregation method

After data collection, the data consolidation process follows. This means we standardize the data across platforms using common metrics (horizontal reconciliation) and align them with your analytics data (vertical reconciliation) to ensure they correspond.

### 3. Simplified Calculation of Your Key Performance Indicators

Indeed, once your site-centric metrics are aligned with your ad-centric metrics, it will be possible to automatically calculate certain KPIs that were previously available only through tedious cross-referencing and compilation of .xls exports.

## Explanations

This unification is made possible through the use of join keys, which we have named `quanti_id`. These are patterns we have created and are used on both the ad-centric and site-centric sides to facilitate the reconciliation of statistics. They are composed of a concatenation of campaign ID, ad group, and ad and allow precise identification of the origin of a metric.

* Site centric: Patterns are used in campaign links configured on advertising platforms, allowing precise tracking of traffic directed to the site from an ad.
* Ad centric side: Patterns are created based on data retrieved through our API connectors. We aggregate data around these patterns, which then allows us to precisely determine the performance of an ad.

By using the same pattern to identify traffic and to collect advertising data, it becomes possible to later aggregate traffic and advertising data thanks to this common key.

### quanti\_id tracking templates

To allow precise reconciliation, each platform has its own quanti\_id template to use. The tracking templates rely on the use of each platform's internal dynamic variables within the analytics parameters of the configured links in the ads. The traffic manager is therefore required to configure the links of the advertisements so that they integrate the correct pattern.

{% hint style="info" %}
For Google Ads, you need to use the following pattern in an analytics parameter:&#x20;

`qid_gad_c{campaignid}_g{adgroupid}_a{creative}`

The information within the braces will be dynamically replaced with the correct IDs durign the broadcast. This allows you to track traffic originating from Google Ads using this pattern on your site analytics tool.

Example of a link generated by the platform:`https://my-website.com?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=qid_gad_c1234_g5678_a90`
{% endhint %}
