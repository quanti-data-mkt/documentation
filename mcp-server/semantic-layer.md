## Why pre-prebuilt transformations ?



QUANTI: manage some transformations, always useful for 100% of our customers.

## How

This chapter deals with the topic of **transformation** and the aggregation work also called [**RECONCILIATION**](../transformations/the-principle-of-reconciliation.md)**.** This is made possible thanks to:&#x20;

* Perfect knowledge of the specificities of advertising partners' APIs allows us to extract data correctly and centralize their storage in client-dedicated Data Warehouses.
* A method to standardize and harmonize data originally coming from different advertising platforms.
* A method to align navigation data (Site-centric - e.g., Google Analytics 4) with campaign data (Ad-centric - e.g., Meta) to automate the calculation of key performance indicators (e.g., Return On Ads Spend).

The general idea of this transformation step is to make the data more digestible and more usable for visualization, analysis, and decision-making purposes.
