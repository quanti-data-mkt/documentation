## <mark style="background-color:purple;">Syncing</mark>

The advanced attribution table is a view. Its data comes directly from the others tables and depends directly on their synchronization frequency. Thus, new conversions will appear on this table once the session has expired, i.e. after a period of inactivity of **30 minutes** after the last hit.

## Description

### Technical Definition of a conversion

From a technical perspective for Quanti, a conversion is a hit where the value of the `conversion_id` parameter is not `null`, `undefined`, or _empty_. One of these conditions must be satisfied to add a new row in the advanced attribution table.

### Primary keys explanations

The advanced attribution table's primary keys are `hit_id` and `s_session_id` :&#x20;

* We have made the decision to insert a field named `hit_id` into the table, which precisely identifies the hit that registered the conversion from `raw_hits`. This ensures the table's integrity by addressing a potential issue with the uniqueness of `conversion_id`. `hit_id` is technically more precise than the `conversion_id`.
* The `s_session_id` is the second primary key of the table and allows linking a session to a conversion. Multiple sessions can participate in the same conversion, and the same session can participate in multiple conversions.

In this table, a single `conversion_id` can be used across multiple rows because it may have been generated by a series of sessions (One row in the table = one session for a given conversion). Similarly, a `session_id` can also be used on multiple rows because it might have originated several conversions. However, what is essentially maintained is the presence of a unique `session_id` per conversion.

### Attibution rules

We have 2 ways to catch up on sessions and assess their contribution to achieving a conversion :

* By **visitor\_id** : We log all previous sessions that have the same `visitor_id` as the session during which the conversion occurred.
* By **user\_id** : We log all previous sessions that have the same `user_id` as the session during which the conversion occurred.

The values `null`, `undefined`, or _empty_ for `visitor_id` and `user_id` are obviously excluded from the attribution calculation rules.

### The paths

Now that you've understood that the table consists of a list of sessions that contributed to achieving conversion(s), it's crucial to know how you can distinguish them from a chronological perspective and especially how you are going to analyze the paths taken by your visitors and calculate the contribution of each session. There is evidently the "s\_datetime" field which gives the exact date and time of the session's start, but we have made the task easier for you by implementing two fields:

* `max_index`: Indicates the total number of contributive sessions related to a conversion. The value of this field is the same for each session (row) for a given conversion.
* `path_index`: indicates the chronological position of the session among all the contributory sessions leading to a conversion.

For a conversion tracking multiple contributive sessions, you will therefore have in `path_index` numbers ranging from 1 to the number representing the total number of sessions. Then, on each line in `max_index`, you will find the maximum number that represents the total number of sessions.

### path\_index

Chronological position of the session among all the contributory sessions leading to a conversion.\
The value "1" represents the session that is the furthest away chronologically from the conversion. The session closest to the conversion (being the one during which the conversion took place) will have the highest number and will be equal to the value of the field `max_index` defined below.

### max\_index

The total number of contributive sessions related to the conversion (define by hit\_id value). The value of this field is the same for each session (row) for a given conversion.

### lookback\_window

The total number of days between the conversion date and the session date.

### is\_last\_clic

Boolean field indicating if the session (the row) is the session that led to the conversion. Technically, this is the session for which `path_index` = `max_index`.

### is\_last\_clic\_non\_direct

Boolean field indicating if the session (the row) is the session that led to the conversion after excluding all sessions with a s\_source value `(direct)` and a s\_medium value `(none)`. Technically, this is the session for which `path_index` is the highest (After excluding (Direct) sources).\
If the conversion is carried out in a single session with s\_source value `(direct)` and a s\_medium value `(none)`, then this single session is considered as the LCND.\
If the conversion is conducted through multiple sessions but all of them have the s\_source value `(direct)` and the s\_medium value `(none)`, then the most recent one of these is considered the LCND.

### is\_post\_clic\_60

### is\_post\_clic\_90

Boolean field indicating if the session (the row) occurred within the 90 days preceding the conversion. Technically, this is the difference between `s_date` and `c_date`.

### is\_post\_clic\_120

Boolean field indicating if the session (the row) occurred within the 120 days preceding the conversion. Technically, this is the difference between `s_date` and `c_date`.

### is\_post\_clic\_180

Boolean field indicating if the session (the row) occurred within the 180 days preceding the conversion. Technically, this is the difference between `s_date` and `c_date`.

### is\_first\_clic\_30
