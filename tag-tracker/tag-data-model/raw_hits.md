### user\_id

Unique user identifier. This identifier has to be specify in the tag. Typically the value is based on a hashed version of the user's email address (using SHA256, for example).

{% hint style="info" %}
A user (identified by a user\_id) can have several devices, and therefore several browsers (identified by several visitors\_id). They can have multiple sessions (identified by multiple session\_id) during which they navigate from page to page and record multiple events, event and page\_view (identified by multiple hit\_id).
