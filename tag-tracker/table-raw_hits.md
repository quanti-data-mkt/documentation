### user\_id

Unique user identifier which is an individual who has logged into their personal account. This identifier has to be specify in the tag and typically based on a hashed version of the user's email address (using SHA256, for example).

{% hint style="info" %}

They can have multiple sessions (identified by multiple session\_id) during which they navigate from page to page and record multiple events, event and page\_view (identified by multiple hit\_id).
